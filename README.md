# Tabby - Chrome New Tab
Tabby is a replacement for the chrome new tab page. It features weather, website shortcuts, a clock, and more. 


## Setting up Config
To change settings for weather and shortcuts, there is a `Config.ts` file located under the `src` directory. This is where you can set your zip code, local weather station ID, and URLs for website shortcuts. 

## Running Project
After downloading the project, use command `yarn` to install dependencies. Use command `yarn start` to run locally. To package and build, use command `yarn run build`. Then open the Chrome extensions page, turn on developer mode, and click the Load Unpacked extension button. Select the build folder to add the extension.
